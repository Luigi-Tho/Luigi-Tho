# Welcome to my Profile!

Hello, newcomer. My name is Luigi-Tho.
I am an aspiring game developer.
I have worked on many games but sometimes you lose motivation to work on projects and you want to start new ones.
I am currently working on a few games that you can find in my repositories.

### Languages I Know
- C++ (the basics)
- A bit of C#
- The tiniest bit of HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- A bit of Python

### Games I am working on
- Turn-based RPG with a street fighter style
- RPG about a girl on a quest to save a prince
- Another project that's in its very, very early stages
