# Welcome to my Profile!

Hello, newcomer. My name is Luigi-Tho.
I am an aspiring game developer.
I have worked on many side projects in my spare time.
I am currently working on some stuff that you can find in my repositories.

### Languages I Know
- C++ (the basics)
- A bit of C#
- The tiniest bit of HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- A bit of Python

### Games I am working on
- Turn-based RPG with a street fighter style
- RPG about a girl on a quest to save a prince
- Another project that's in its very, very early stages

### Other projects I've been working on
- My own custom virtual assistant
- An app that gets school assignments from every app that your school uses and lists them in one place (in the planning stages).
